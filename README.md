# Fourier-Position-Embedding

This repository contains the code for the paper "Fourier Position Embedding: Enhancing Attentionâ€™s Periodic Extension for Length Generalization".

Our code is totally based on OLMo(https://github.com/allenai/OLMo). The core code of FoPE and main setup is available in the appendix of our paper, thus you can also integrate FoPE directly into any other repository.
